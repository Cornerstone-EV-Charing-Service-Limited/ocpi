## Building Process

The OCPI Build Process has been improved. OCPI 2.0/2.1.1 was in markdown format, and diagrams where Plantuml.

For OCPI 2.2, the text of OCPI has been converted to asciidoc. 
Asciidoc is easier to format the output, and chapter numbering and internal links are much easier to work with.

The Plantuml is no longer converted to PNG images, but the SVG, making them much better readable, and even searchable in the PDF.

In OCPI 2.0 and 2.1.1, the JSON examples contained a lot of mistakes, where outdated compared to the text, or not even valid JSON. 
To prevent issues with the examples in the specification, the examples are not placed in separate JSON files. 
At the moment, the JSON files are check if they are valid JSON.

----
1 Dec 2014 [Draft v4](releases/old/OCPI-Draftv4.pdf) is published
17 June 2015 [Draft v5] is moved to a new branch that will be used as a reference as the OCPI specifications are being redefined and the specifications are restructured in different files, a file per chapter
